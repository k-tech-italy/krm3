# Task entry

A log of hours spent by a <glossary:Resource> in the context of a task at a given date.

## Task entry hours

Hours spent on a task are classified as such:

* **Day shift hours**: hours spent working on the task during regular office hours (e.g. 9-to-5).
* **Night shift hours**: hours spent working on the task at night time. Night time work is logged separately from day time work as it is invoiced differently.
* **Travel hours**: hours spent traveling while on a <glossary:Mission>.
* **Rest hours**: hours allocated as rest, e.g. as compensation for overtime.
* **On-call hours**: hours allocated as rest, e.g. as compensation for overtime.

!!! note

    On-call hours count towards compensation of a resource, but they do not count towards the total hours tally. A resource, in fact, may be on-call for a set amount of hours without having to do any work.

## Logging task entries

To log a task entry, a resource should:

* click in the cell of the task's lane corresponding to the work day;
* fill in the form that appears with the hours spent on the task and submit it.

Clicking on an esisting task entry lets resources update it using the same form as above.

Dragging along a task lane and submitting the form creates one copy of the submitted entry for that task on each of the selected days.

Dragging an existing entry along its task lane will create a copy of the dragged entry.

!!! note

    Editing the form before submitting will affect the dragged entry and all its copies.

!!! warning

    Dragging over existing entries and submitting the form will replace those entries.

!!! warning

    Logging a task entry will delete any existing <glossary:Day Entry|holiday or sick day entry> on the same day.

## Notes

See <glossary:Day Entry> for details on the additional restrictions in place if leave hours are logged.
